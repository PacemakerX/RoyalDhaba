         <p>Royal Dhaba, formerly (An Establishment of Jagat Narayan Soni & sons) the multi-cusine food court, Sweet shop and hotel, all under one roof. A name that has been enjoying a pristine image for nearly a century now.</p>
           
          <p>Since its inception in 1925, we worked hard to offer our clientele best quality products wrapped. We focus on hygiene and proper care of all product quality. Thus… today we possess the reputation of being one of the leading firms in this trade. From a traditional shop in Aminabad, we expanded into a modern ambience in the heart of the city, ever maintaining the original taste, superior quality and utmost standards of hygiene and freshness.</p>
           
          <p> Down the years, we have not just conserved the essence of traditional sweets, but have also catered to the changing taste of modern times-adding that "dash of innovation" to conventional merrymaking. Enjoying a top-notch clientele…today, we are privileged to be recognized far and wide. Because you are the inspiration…we owe it too totally!</p>
